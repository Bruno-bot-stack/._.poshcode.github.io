<h1>HELP</h1>
<h3><a href="//scripts/5975.ps1">download</a></h3>
<p>I need help using the greater than and less than symbol, and it needs to compare two different variables within the code.
For example, the $number is any random number between 1-100, When one enters in a number to guess, I need it to say &quot;Sorry your guess was too low. You are getting warm&quot; if the players guess was -20 away from the random $number. Down below I have the code I am using now and its not working so well. I have tried numerous numbers or different ways, and I need some help. Thanks</p>
