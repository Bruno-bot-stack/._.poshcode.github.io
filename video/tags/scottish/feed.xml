<p>Agenda:</p>
<p>7.00pm - Introduction and News</p>
<p>7.15pm - 'Don't Reinvent the Wheel, Just Realign It' by Josh King (@WindosNZ)
&quot;More than ever, time to market can make or break business initiatives and your ability to quickly deliver quality tooling is critical.
Yeah, I know: It is fun to wade into a new project and build something from nothing. We know what we need to know to get the job done, and surely no one else could have done a better job of it … right?
The reality is that you’re probably reinventing a wheel.
Using existing PowerShell modules, .NET libraries, and APIs, can help you build your own tools much faster. This frees you up to focus on the specifics of your problem rather than the underlying, time-consuming, foundation.
Be the time efficient, tool building hero your organization needs, not a speed bump!&quot;</p>
<p>8.15pm - Break</p>
<p>8.20pm - 'Hitchikers Guide to user-friendly module design' by Friedrich Weinmann (@FredWeinmann)</p>
<p>9.30pm - Thank You’s</p>]]></description>
