<p>Windows PowerShell and WMI are a match made in Redmond... Seriously, these two &quot;Power&quot; houses are spectacular, awe-inspiring, breathtaking and amazing when fused together.  This coming April 28th, Windows PowerShell fiends, myself included, will descend upon the Meydenbauer Center in Bellevue, WA with a mouthwatering appetite for some PowerShell goodness, gluten free.  To satisfy that hardy hunger, come to my session where you'll discover &quot;The Seven Secrets of CIM&quot;.  It's sure to be a PowerShell blast, you will walk away with real world knowledge that you can start practicing immediately.</p>]]></description>

<p>Whether you're performing incident response, black box code analysis, or analyzing malicious code, PowerShell is a powerful tool to add to your reverse engineering tool arsenal. In this talk, you will learn how to use PowerShell to analyze binary file formats and reverse engineer managed and unmanaged code. The talk will conclude with an analysis of a real-world malware sample.</p>

<p>When asked what to do about corporate hacking, Ex NSA Director Michael Hayden replied, &quot;Man up and defend yourselves&quot;.   Within a few years, Edward Snowden rocked the world by disclosing information he had gathered using his NSA administrative privileges.  JitJea stands for Just In Time, Just Enough Admin.  It is a PowerShell toolkit that you can use to &quot;man up and defend yourselves&quot; by allowing people to perform admin tasks without giving them admin privileges</p>]]></description>

				<title>Cmdlet-ize the Registry - Richard Siddaway - PowerShell Summit 2014</title>

				<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkzAHUndq4w"><img src="https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/xkzAHUndq4w/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Cmdlet-ize the Registry - Richard Siddaway - PowerShell Summit 2014" title="Cmdlet-ize the Registry - Richard Siddaway - PowerShell Summit 2014" /></a></p>
<p>PowerShell supplies a number of ways for you to work with the Registry. On the local machine you have the registry provider -- but you can't use it against remote machines. For remote access you can use WMI or .NET. The WMI, CIM and WSMAN cmdlets can be used to work with the registry on remote machines. All of these cmdlets involve using large constants and an awkward syntax with no consistencies between them. This session will show you how to create your own module to work with the registry on the local or remote machines. Using the CDXML -- objects over cmdlets -- technology introduced with PowerShell 3.0 you can take the registry WMI class and make cmdlets to search for , read, write, create and delete items in the registry. Your take away is a module of cmdlets that enable you to work easily with the registry. You will aslo understend the techniques you can use to create your own cmdlets from WMI classes -- this is the way Microsoft writes many of their cmdlets.</p>]]></description>

<p>Windows PowerShell is becoming increasingly common in all forms of security: administration, operations, and of course security penetration testing and research. This talk will demonstrate how attackers leverage PowerShell for post-exploitation tasks once they break in to a system. We'll show how to help prevent these attacks by following PowerShell's security best practices for both scripting and operational tasks. Buckle your seatbelts!</p>]]></description>
