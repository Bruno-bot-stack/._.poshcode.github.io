<p>Topic: Never in Plain Text: Protecting Credentials in PowerShell Scripts
Least-privilege security means two things:</p>
<p>You operate your system as a standard user;
Your scripts generally require different credentials
We never want plain text credentials in our scripts. In this session, Tim performs a survey of the most common (and uncommon) methods to protect credentials in PowerShell source code. We will embrace both community modules as well as Azure Key Vault in our discussion.</p>

<p>Presenter(s): <em>Joel “Jaykul” Bennett:</em>
With a brief overview of Donald Knuth’s decades old concept of literate programming, we’ll get an introduction to it’s modern application to DevOps. Learn how you can create programs, deployment scripts, and automation tools with significantly better documentation by changing your attitude toward the construction of programs: concentrate on explaining to human beings what you want the computer to do. We’ll also look at some related tools, like Binder, Jupyter Hubs and Labs, nteract and Hydrogen, with Atom.</p>]]></description>

<p>Having fun with PowerShell 6.0 – JEA, remoting and cross-
platform
With the recent release of PowerShell 6.0 a lot of questions about remoting, using it across different platforms and what the implications are for JEA. In this session we will briefly go over these core concepts before diving into what PowerShell 6.0 brings to the table and what we are going to pay attention to in the future.
If you are already working with PowerShell 6.0 and you have specific questions be sure to have them prepared, as Yaap will be more than happy to go beyond the content covered in this session.</p>
